# Problems With Previous Approach

Problems using JavaFX API and not FXML

* Big changes making no impact
* Small changes impacting a lot
* One big takeaway from this is that generating UI using code is not intuitive 
and is error prone and less readable. Code is good for writing the logic that 
should be executed behind the user interface. However, it is not suitable 
for designing the user interface. This is where the declarative creation
of user interface comes into play. FXML plays a pivotal role in this approach.
