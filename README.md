# General Guide 

This repository contains all the files and projects made in class. 

There are two branches for the moment

**master** -> which contains all the software that works correctly. 

**Quarantine** -> which contains all the software that need to be fixed in home. This branch is an *orphan* branch.
An orphan branch does not have a parent-child relationship to the master branches’ commits.
Most commits have one parent commit, one obvious exception being root commits which have no parent commits. 
Creating an orphan branch will retain the working tree of the branch it’s based on, but without an ancestor commit.

**Quarantine doesn't retains the working tree of the master branch, it has its own working tree.**

When the software is debugged and corrected you can proceed by uploading the project to the **master** branch.

**The objective of these branches must be respected.**
