# General Guide 

This repository contains all the files and projects made in class. 

There are two branches for the moment

**master** -> which contains all the software that works correctly. 

**Quarantine** -> which contains all the software that need to be fixed in home. 

When the software is debugged and corrected you can proceed by uploading the project to the **master** branch.

**The objective of these branches must be respected.**
